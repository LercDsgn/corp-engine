# CORP Engine

## What is CORP Engine? x
CORP Engine is an game engine/toolkit made with Pygame.

### Why should I use it?
- It can really make your python game development experience more organized, faster, and better in general.
- It has **built-in parent-children system** with **game objects** and **services** to use. 
- It is very simple and efficient to work with compared to Pygame
- Also, the entire engine code is in a **single file**, making it _really_ easy to set up.

### How can I set it up?
* You can use this repository as a template or  `git clone` it to your local machine. _This will require [git](https://git-scm.com)._ (Recommended method) 
* Alternatively, you can download `corpengine.py` file and `res` folder to a new project folder.
