An engine made with Pygame for Python game development.

## What is CORP Engine and Why Should I Use It?
CORP Engine is an engine/toolkit made with Pygame which can really make your python game development experience more organized, faster, and better in general. It works with a built-in parent-children system with gameObjects and services to use. Also, the entire engine code is in a single file, making it _really_ easy to set up.

### Guide For Setting up CORP Engine
* You can use this repository as a template if you want, or  `git clone` it to your local machine. _(This will require git.)_
* Alternatively, you can download `corpengine.py` file and `res` folder to a new project folder, but I would still recommend method 1.
